   <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Kadhai Paneer is a popular North Indian dish made with paneer (Indian cottage cheese), bell peppers, and a blend of freshly ground spices. The dish gets its name from the traditional Indian wok called "Kadhai," in which it is prepared. The vibrant flavors of spices and vegetables make it a great accompaniment to naan, roti, or rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>200g Paneer (cubed)</li>
        <li>1 Onion (sliced)</li>

        <li>Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for a minute until the raw aroma disappears.</li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and blend with the onion mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed coriander seeds, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Stir well.</li>
