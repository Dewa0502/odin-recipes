    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Chole Bhature</strong> is a popular North Indian dish that combines a spicy and flavorful chickpea curry (Chole) with fluffy, deep-fried bread (Bhature). 
        The chickpeas are simmered in a rich tomato-onion gravy, seasoned with aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala, creating a hearty and satisfying meal. 
        The Bhature, made from all-purpose flour and yogurt, is soft on the inside with a crispy exterior, making it perfect for scooping up the curry. 
        This dish is often enjoyed for breakfast or lunch, accompanied by slices of onion, lemon wedges, and green chilies, making it a beloved favorite in Indian cuisine.
